# PairwiseApproach

To run the pairwise_stacking, run code/run.py for all the datasets (that satisfying the daatset criteria written in code/split_data.py/data_check()).

Currently, the size of datasets to be run is set to be between 90 - 100. If you wish to change the limit, go to code/split_data.py/data_check() to change the size range

To get a general understanding of the working flow, I suggest to run code/test_run.py which performs stacking on the test datasets, test_case.csv.
